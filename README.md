## Build

This is a pure Rust codebase, so building it is straightforward with `cargo`
```sh
cargo build --workspace --release 
```

For playing around, use the included CLI package
```sh
cargo run --package sketch-cli # -- more args here
```

## Usage

Usage examples and explainations will be filled in later.
